          <h6>Background</h6>
          <p>
            While our team was working on <a href="golfshot" class="link">Golfshot</a>, something exciting emerged: Apple announced ARKit, software that enabled iPhones for native augmented reality (AR) development. Using your phone's camera, AR apps can display digital and useful information over what's captured in any physical environment. This fit our persona and use case perfectly because many golfers use 3rd party on-course rangefinders all the time to view distances. Why not have that live on your mobile phone?
          </p>
          <h6>Opportunity</h6>
          <p>
            This was not only bleeding edge technology for the golfing industry, but a perfect alternative solution for our users. At the time, Golfshot only displayed distances and data on your screen in a 2D environment, which had its limitations. Golfers dealing with sunlight brightness and top-down GPS views don't get the full picture for how far they are to the hole. With Golfscape and AR, we can bring those distances into the foreground by providing a familiar and similar experience a modern rangefinder does and more.
          </p>
          <h6>Hypothesis</h6>
          <p>
            We believe higher on-course engagement and satisfaction will be achieved by providing an alternative way to view distances with AR display and interaction.
          </p>

            <h3>Form Hypothesis</h3>
            <h6>Lean Canvas</h6>
            <p>As a team, we each filled out our own lean canvas to identify business and user outcomes. This is a great way to get everyone on the same page and narrow down important aspects of a new product:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Problem: limiting ways to view distances and valuable data</li>
              <li>Solution: provide an alternative, cutting-edge way that's new but familiar</li>
              <li>Key Metrics: subscription, renewal, and adoption rates</li>
              <li>Value Propostion: Using just your phone camera, get a new and familiar on-course experience with distance and target data</li>
              <li>Customer Segments: casual and amateur golfers looking to improve</li>
            </ul>
            <h6>Our Hypothesis</h6>
            <p>
              Once the canvas was established, we put together a clear hypothesis statement:
              <br><br>
              <i>We believe higher on-course engagement and satisfaction will be achieved by providing an alternative way to view distances with AR display and interaction.</i>

            <h3>Discovery</h3>
            <h6>Gather Feedback</h6>
            <p>We wanted to figure out how golfers would respond to Golfscape/AR and see if our hypothesis held water. With a combination of Google Form surveys and in-person conversations, we discovered that AR, pin and green reading were frequent asks, even before AR was available as a mobile golf option. This instantly validated our need for Golfscape.</p>
            <p>General Findings</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Distance to the Pin and AR green reading are among the most popular feature suggestions</li>
              <li>More than 1,500 users suggested that statistics and data visualization be enhanced</li>
              <li>General interest in AR and its technology is surprisingly high</li>
            </ul>
            <h6>Compile Brief</h6>
            <p>Using this feedback and our lean canvas, we put together a centralized brief that outlined goals, needs, and initial tech specs about Golfscape. This would pave way for our strategy, iteration, and development over the next couple months.</p>

            <h3>Empathize and Define</h3>
            <h6>Understand the User</h6>
            <p>Once we confirmed the need for Golfscape, we needed a refresher on how golfers play and what their processes are. Using quantitative and qualitative feedback gathered from its parent app <a href="golfshot" class="link">Golfshot</a>, we broke down our persona:</p>
            <p>Demographic</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Older (35-65 years old)</li>
              <li>84% male, 16% female</li>
              <li>Social/casual golfers (1-4 times per month)</li>
              <li>Like-amateurs/competitors (5+ per month and tournament play)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Needs</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A GPS that displays distances</li>
              <li>Solves issue of not knowing how far distances are by eye/intuition</li>
              <li>Automates manual tasks to save time and uninterrupt playing</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Behaviors</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Looking to improve some aspects of their game</li>
              <li>Constantly surveying for ideal distance/target</li>
              <li>Think 2 shots ahead</li>
              <li>Score to advance to the next hole</li>
            </ul>
            <h6>Problems</h6>
            <p>We then identified pain points to see if we can get ahead of potential issues for Golfscape:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Poor GPS reception</li>
              <li>Navigation and scoring UX is clunky</li>
              <li>Not as familiar as a conventional rangefinder</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

            <h3>Technical Understanding and Ideation</h3>
            <h6>Key Aspects</h6>
            <p>In combination of user needs/problems and technical specs, we drew key aspects and patterns to work off of:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Calibration: per ARKit specs, users need a way to calibrate their iPhone prior to activating AR</li>
              <li>Onboard: Since this is a completely new interaction set, we need to easily onboard users with simple tutorials and dismissible information</li>
              <li>Clear: Design elements should be in the forefront and as clear/obvious to use as possible since it overlays contrasting objects</li>
              <li>Fast: Display relavent information as soon as possible, even if it's static; Don't impede the on-course experience</li>
            </ul>
            <h6>Ideas</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>Simple tutorial dialog on first use explaining calibration and features</li>
              <li>"Point your camera to this target" calibration process</li>
              <li>Viewable HUD of course aerial image and targets in front of them</li>
              <li>Scrollable distances in the foreground since a hole can have up to 20 data points</li>
              <li>Toolbar: hole changing, scoring, recalibration and settings</li>
            </ul>
            <h6>Design Goals</h6>
            <p>I started visualizing and noting design-level goals. This paved way for user flow concepts and sketching/wireframing:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Make scrollable distance/data points obvious to scroll (fade-away)</li>
              <li>Design elements should be high contrast against the environment</li>
              <li>Tutorial dialog should be dismissable and brief</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Prototyping</h3>
            <h6>Sketches and Wireframes</h6>
            <p>With technical understanding and mapping ironed out, I took to my mobile grid paper and started sketching out UI concepts and diagrams. Designing for AR was a challenge because I had to constantly put myself in the mindset of looking through a lens for data visualization. Once I stepped outside the conventional 2D form factor, it took me a while to grasp how design elements would react in 3D. Things like depth of field, how users would interact with their phones in that position, and panning sensitivity all became factors. After several rounds of stakeholder and team design reviews, I began to refine the mockups into higher fidelity wireframes.</p>
            <a class="link" href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/dcf1802f-4ad0-4a81-7647-9f92a4959d3b-aac0/grid" target="_blank">
              <i class="fas fa-vector-square"></i> &nbsp;  View Wireframes
            </a>
            <h6>High Fidelity Prototypes and Flows</h6>
            <p>I then translated the wireframes into high fidelity click-through prototypes in Adobe XD. We circled back with the team with these mock-ups for internal demos and feedback loops with local golfers. The result was a solid prototype our devs can rely on for beta development and thorough testing.</p>

            <h3>Test and Iterate</h3>
            <h6>User Beta Testing</h6>
            <p>Once we developed a working beta of the first prototype, we sent it out to a handful of users for a first round of field testing.</p>
            <p>Findings</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Calibration: Arrow buttons to adjust target were slow and hard to use</li>
              <li>Scoring: Needed a more obvious/exposed way to score from Golfscape</li>
              <li>Distances: The distances overlay was "cool" and "inventive" but unreliable and hard to read</li>
              <li>UI: Displayed too much information at once and users were wasting time trying to figure it all out</li>
              <li><i>Satisfaction Score: 6.2/10</i></li>
            </ul>
            <h6>Iteration</h6>
            <p>Back in the lab, we focused on improving the calibration UX and general UI since those were critical to our hypothesis of better engagement and interactivity. I went back to the drawing board, iterated on more designs, moved it into development, and shipped a fresh beta to a new set of users for testing.</p>
            <p>Second Round Findings</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Calibration: Easy to use by just pointing the camera at target and confirming</li>
              <li>Scoring: Access was clear with a now-exposed button and kept them in the AR experience</li>
              <li>Distances: GPS data was much more accurate, larger/easier to read, and unobtrusive</li>
              <li>UI: Scrolling distances instead of revealing all it at once kept it clean and simple</li>
              <li><i>Satisfaction Score: 8.7/10</i></li>

            After identifying and solving user problems in design time and testing, we were able to launch Golfscape ahead of the 2018 golf season and continually improved it into the offseason. It saw great adoption within its parent app Golfshot and was positioned as the industry's first golf AR product to market.
