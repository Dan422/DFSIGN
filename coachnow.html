          <h6>Background</h6>
          <p>
            While working on <a href="golfshot" target="_blank" class="link">Golfshot</a> in 2017, we acquired a remote coaching company called Edufii. Their intent was to provide a way for individual coaches to share instructional media and curated content with athletes/clients via mobile and web apps in order to grow their business. The main features of the product were robust video analysis/telestration tools and private, interactive feeds called TrainingSpaces.
          </p>
          <h6>Opportunity</h6>
          <p>
            Working primarily in the sports and golf industries at the time, Edufii (rebranded to CoachNow) felt like a good segue into a familiar and promising, yet competitive space. We inherited a nascent product to rebuild and had to strategize our technical, business, and marketing position against an already crowded industry dominated by the likes of Hudl, TeamSnap, and Coach.me. With a thorough rebrand and complete design and technical overhaul, we essentially had to start over from the beginning.
          </p>
          <h6>Hypothesis</h6>
          <p>
            User: We believe better communication and teachable moments between coaches and athletes can be achieved by providing essential tools associated with "learning" and "teaching" while centralizing training information for easier access and reference.
            <br><br>
            Business: We believe higher adoption rates and engagement with CoachNow will occur by positioning it as the top sports coaching app and thought leader in the coaching/training space.

                <h3>Product Vision and Consensus</h3>
                <h6>Vision Boards</h6>
                <p>With the acquisition done, all the leadership teams converged on our vision for CoachNow. We each filled out product vision boards, discussed and adjusted them, and came to a consensus on our KPIs, personas, and business goals. This was a great way to get teams on the same page and narrow down key aspects of a product:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Vision: Make coaches lives better and their coaching more efficient</li>
                  <li>Users: Coaches, athletes, parents, recruiters</li>
                  <li>Problem: The loss of communication and valuable information that takes place during practices</li>
                  <li>Solution: A singular/centralized tool for coaches to put all training information in one place and communicate from</li>
                  <li>Product: Mobile and web apps</li>
                  <li>Business Goal: Establish CoachNow as the top sports coaching app and as a thought leader</li>
                </ul>
                <h6>Our Hypothesis</h6>
                <p>
                  With this established, we put together two hypothesis statements:
                  <br><br>
                  <i>User: We believe better communication and teachable moments between coaches and athletes can be achieved by providing essential tools associated with "learning" and "teaching" while centralizing training information for easier access and reference.

                  Business: We believe higher adoption rates and engagement with CoachNow will occur by positioning it as the top sports coaching app and thought leader in the coaching/training space.</i>

                <h3>Audit and Analyze</h3>
                <h6>Product Auditing</h6>
                <p>With a vision and direction paved way, we immediately set to work on auditing the existing Edufii mobile apps since they were high priority. This included sending out user surveys for specific UX and feature feedback loops, breaking down the existing iOS and Android design and noting indifferences or fallbacks, and forming patterns to act on:
                <ul>
                  <li>There was a lack of feature and design parity between iOS and Android apps</li>
                  <li>Most users explored 2 or 3 features and used them in very different ways</li>
                  <li>Significantly larger ratio between coaches and athletes (1:7) for free users</li>
                  <li>A surprising majority of coaches handle both 1-on-1 and team instruction</li>
                  <li>The apps' design and functionality deviated from common interaction UX and practices, causing cognitive dissonance with users and confusion</li>
                </ul>
                <h6>Analyze and High-Level Action Items</h6>
                <p>By listening to users, we not only got incredible insight into Edufii but also debunked previous notions and initiatives, saving us a lot of time by narrowing the scope. We compiled this data, drew some patterns and association, and put it all into a running document for editing and leadership review:
                <ul>
                  <li>Instead of creating more features to handle different use cases, create just 1 feature that generates the same outcomes</li>
                  <li>Rethink the current apps navigation, information architecture, and UX to improve accessibility and clarity</li>
                  <li>Implement tracking to objectify KPIs and form data-driven decisions</li>
                  <li>Focus on improving the communication UX in the long term vs. prescribing more tools/hot fixes in the short term</li>
                  <li>Streamline media and video analysis capturing for mobile</li>
                </ul>

                <h6>Understand the User</h6>
                <p>After diving into the existing product, I started exploring various ways of gathering more information about our persona. From many interviews and focus groups with coaches, empathy mapping, and Mixpanel behavioral metrics, I put together a clear snapshot of our target users:</p>
                <p>Demographic</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>People who chose coaching as a career</li>
                  <li>Trains 1-on-1 or with teams</li>
                  <li>Wears multiple hats and performs many jobs outside of coaching</li>
                  <li>Coaching as their job or looking to start their own practice/business</li>

                  <li>Clear, uncluttered channels for communication and follow-ups</li>
                  <li>Improved athlete retention and encouraged feedback</li>

                <h3>Define</h3>
                <h6>Existing Problems and Needs</h6>
                <p>Focusing on both the existing app and routines/work life of our established coaching persona, we put together a dashboard centralizing all the problems noted from our audit, interviews, and past feedback. As the process went on, patterns began to emerge from the mobile app that validated our new theories and debunked old ones:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Easier Communication: We discovered that coaches couldn't avoid using multiple tools and just needed them be intuitive, centralized, and seamless for communicating with athletes/clients so they can focus on preparing materials</li>
                  <li>Lack of Important Features: The app had too many confusing, one-off features that either did the same thing but in different ways, weren't used as originally intended, or not used at all. Instead, coaches want simple tools that felt familiar with their daily routines and eased their process, like scheduling posts, one-click onboarding, and real-time chat</li>
                  <li>Clunky UX and Navigation: Coaches have their hands full with many tasks, and all of them explained that the last thing they want to deal with is figuring how to use another new app</li>
                  <li>Notification Overload: While using the app, many coaches get bombarded with too many notifications and they have to sort through them to find what they actually care about. They wanted finite control of this and to have notifications come in bulk</li>
                  <li>Poor Media Quality and Bugs: The app had consistent issues with uploading and sharing large media files and telestrations. There was a large quality loss and coaches would lose hours of curated content if it crashed, leading to high abandon rates and negative reviews</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Ideate</h3>
                <h6>Converging and Realization</h6>
                <p>With problems and needs with the mobile app laid out before us, we went back in with the team and started brainstorming and discussing ideas. After working through them by design sprinting, we came to the realization that the mobile app was trying to do far too much.
                  <br><br>
                   From tracking/retention data and feedback, most coaches only used our mobile app for 1.) capturing, telestrating, and sharing media with athletes and 2.) quickly reviewing their content in their Space/feeds. This made perfect sense because coaches only had fragments of time to use the app in person with athletes and only focused on capturing teachable moments for further revew later on the web app.
                </p>
                <h6>Solutions and Focus</h6>
                <p>This immediately gave us a good path to follow and led to a series of objectives:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Improve telestration UX: The media capturing feature of the app was crucial for coaches and we wanted to remove  unnecessary UI, improve upload quality, and fix crashing as soon as possible</li>
                  <li>Get iOS in parity with Android: The Android app was much further along in terms of reliability and stability. iOS was fairly new and needed improved design, code framework, and navigation patterns</li>
                  <li>Merge TrainingSpaces and Teams: The app had two very similar feeds called TrainingSpaces and Teams, but the difference was TrainingSpaces didn't allow for multiple athletes to join. We wanted to merge these two features into one so coaches didn't have to choose or figure out which was best for their use case and allowed for any number of people to join</li>
                  <li>Revamp Onboarding: The app had very little to no onboarding nor welcome sequences. Users would be dumped into a blank feed and either they'd reach out to support, fend for themselves, or dropoff. We wanted to craft simple onboarding steps to have coaches create their first Space, quickly post content, and one-click invite athletes</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Strategy, Design System, and Prototype</h3>
                <h6>Approach</h6>
                <p>Before designing, I put together a strategy detailing our UX and improvement roadmap. We decided to start with the telestration and posting UX, seeing that was the most used area of the mobile apps, and work our way out from there. We'd then tackle getting features in parity between iOS and Android, improving onboarding for both, and then applying our new and evolving design system as we went along.</p>

                </a>
                <h6>Information Architecture, Sketching and Wireframes</h6>
                <p>We immediately hit the ground running with building information architecture that portrayed the mobile apps navigation and nested features at a high level. This made sketching and wireframing much easier because our IA gave us a clear picture of where features lived and why. Whiteboard sessions, paper sketches, and translating it into digital wireframes soon followed.</p>
                <h6>Form Design System</h6>
                <p>In conjunction with higher level design artifacts, I started building our design system. Instead of thinking about designs as just large templates, we wanted to use this system to break down designs into their most basic elements and use them to assemble views in various, but visually consistent ways. As I went a long, I documented elements and why/where to use them:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Principles and purpose: Why we are doing this and how it helps teams and users</li>
                  <li>Design language: Typography, colors, spacing and imagery standards</li>
                  <li>Components: Navigation bars, table cells, segment bars, media viewers, post containers, etc.</li>
                </ul>

                <h6>Prototypes</h6>
                <p>Using Adobe XD and shared libraries with these new design system components, I started designing views and flows in high fidelity and sharing them with users and stakeholders for review and iterations.</p>

                <h3>Betas, Feedback Loops, and Iteration</h3>
                <h6>Beta Releases and Feedback</h6>
                <p>We held daily standups to review designed prototypes and presented them to stakeholders and a handful of power users weekly. Once the app went into development, we released a beta to more coaches for field testing. Results:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Video telestration and posting to players was much simpler to use and understand</li>
                  <li>Still need the ability to bulk upload media and schedule posts</li>
                  <li>Naming conventions for features are still confusing, consider changing or removing them</li>
                  <li>Notifications would be better in bulk instead of real-time</li>
                  <li>The rebrand to "CoachNow" made more sense for the app's purpose</li>
                </ul>
                <h6>Rolling NPS and Satisfaction Scores</h6>
                <p>While repeating this process several times, we setup rolling NPS metrics and kept a close eye on satisfaction scores for our various outcomes. Over an 8 month span, we noticed the UX improved and dropoff/abandonment rates decreased as our NPS went from 40.3 to 51.8.</p>
                <h6>Improving</h6>
                <p>Approaching the launch of our new mobile app, we went back to the lab to respond to this feedback and create more patterns to act on. Overall, the amount of work we put in after getting feedback loops in place made a significant impact on user outcomes and also took half the time to implement with our design system.</p>

                When we launched CoachNow in the Spring of 2018, we continued to learn from feedback and applied our findings to iterate. Prior to my departure from the company in 2019, we put together a "rocket ship" mobile prototype for further user testing and a <a href="https://dfsign.co/docs/coachnow-product-brief.pdf" class="link" target="_blank">lean product brief</a> for handoff.

                <h3>Strategy and Approach</h3>
                <h6>Introduction</h6>
                <p>After putting together our vision boards, establishing an hypothesis, and in parallel with working through our mobile app, we had considerations and decisions to make for another big piece: the web app. Like its mobile counterpart, it was in great need of user research, improved design, a better coding framework, and thorough testing.</p>
                <h6>Form Objectives and Roadmap</h6>
                <p>Since mobile apps took priority after the acquisition, web app required more of a lighter lift in the short term. It already performed basic product requirements, like posting content, inviting athletes, profile management, etc. and was essentially a pre-built MVP. We decided to put toghether a roadmap for working on web app in conjunction with mobile:<br><br>
                1.) Do a short term light design update for brand parity with marketing assets<br>
                2.) Audit and analyze current web app user behavior to set clearer KPIs and direction for web<br>
                3.) Use design thinking and sprints to uncover problems and solve for them<br>
                4.) Redesign, rebuild, and continuously release a more robust web app

                <h3>Audit and Analyze</h3>
                <h6>Product Auditing</h6>
                <p>One of the first objectives on our roadmap was to audit the existing Edufii web app. Following the same process we did for mobile, we sent out user surveys for UX and feature feedback loops and broke down the existing design and structure for audit. Findings:
                <ul>
                  <li>Users in general had difficulty navigating various pages</li>
                  <li>The Feed and TrainingSpace features were the most utilized by far</li>
                  <li>Commenting on posts and uploading media were the two highest pinged events</li>
                  <li>Only 15% of coaches used the web app at all, but 70% of athletes/clients did</li>
                  <li>A surprising majority of coaches handle both 1-on-1 and team instruction</li>
                  <li>Many commented that the app's design and aesthetic felt inconsistent or incomplete</li>
                </ul>
                <h6>Analyze and High-Level Action Items</h6>
                <p>We got great insight into the web app by listening to users right off the bat. It saved us a lot of time in the long run by focusing on the real issues at hand. After compiling this feedback and data, we started noticing some patterns to act on:
                <ul>
                  <li>Instead of creating more features to handle different use cases, create just 1 feature that generates the same outcomes</li>
                  <li>Align the current apps navigation, design patterns, and UX with mobile for a consistent cross-platform experience</li>
                  <li>Implement tracking to objectify KPIs and form data-driven decisions</li>
                  <li>Focus on improving the communication UX in the long term vs. prescribing more tools/hot fixes in the short term</li>
                  <li>Streamline posting, sharing, and interacting on web</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Empathize</h3>
                <h6>Understand the User</h6>
                <p>In parellel with the mobile app, we explored various ways of gathering more information about our persona. From many interviews and focus groups with coaches, empathy mapping, and Mixpanel behavioral metrics, I put together a clear snapshot of our target users:</p>
                <p>Demographic</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>People who chose coaching as a career</li>
                  <li>Trains 1-on-1 or with teams</li>
                  <li>Wears multiple hats and performs many jobs outside of coaching</li>
                  <li>Coaching as their job or looking to start their own practice/business</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Needs</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Better work/life balance</li>
                  <li>Being more time efficient with coaching</li>
                  <li>Clear, uncluttered channels for communication and follow-ups</li>
                  <li>Improved athlete retention and encouraged feedback</li>

                <ul>
                  <li>Uses multiple online and analog tools for sharing curated content</li>

                <h3>Define</h3>
                <h6>Existing Problems and Needs</h6>
                <p>We then put together a dashboard centralizing all the problems noted from our audit, interviews, and past feedback. As the process went on, patterns began to emerge from the web app that validated our new theories and debunked old ones. One important thing we noted was users were experiencing issues similar to that of the mobile apps:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Easier Communication: We discovered that coaches couldn't avoid using multiple tools and just needed them be intuitive, centralized, and seamless for communicating with athletes/clients so they can focus on preparing materials</li>
                  <li>Feature Confusion: The web app had a plethora of handy features for athlete and content organization, but were difficult to learn from lack of onboarding, strange naming convention, and burying in the UI</li>
                  <li>Clunky UX and Navigation: The original navigation looked like it was on the right track to becoming a familiar sidebar platform experience, but fell off over time. Band-aid fixes, random UI redundancies, and inconsistent interaction sets caused obstruction</li>
                  <li>Notification Overload: While using the app, many coaches get bombarded with too many notifications and they have to sort through them to find what they actually care about. They wanted finite control of this and to have notifications come in bulk</li>
                  <li>Need Bulk Media Uploading: The app only supported uploading one media file at a time, causing headaches for a bulk of our users needing to upload many for faster processing</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Ideate</h3>
                <h6>Converging and Realization</h6>
                <p>Having similar issues as mobile made is easy for us to quickly understand where user frustration and confusion came from with the web app. After discussing ideas and holding design sprints, we came to the conclusion that although web and mobile apps performed almost the same functions, coaches and athletes both used them in entirely different ways.
                <br><br>
                From tracking/retention data and feedback, most coaches, though a small amount of them on web app, mainly used it for creating and managing TrainingSpaces and inviting/responding to athletes. Most of the other features were largely ignored. Athletes also followed the same behavior, only logging in to review and respond to coaching content. Contrary to the mobile app, which was used sporatically during training sessions, the web app was used for longer durations of time after sessions were over and during off-hours.
                </p>
                <h6>Solutions and Focus</h6>
                <p>This immediately gave us a good path to follow and led to a series of objectives:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Improve inviting and onboarding: Since athletes were the majority users of the web app, we wanted to make their experience joining as seamless as possible</li>
                  <li>Consider renaming or removing unecessary features: There were 4 other features that all performed helpful actions for coaches to manage their TrainingSpace/Team content, but were built in a backwards and confusing way. This in combination of using confusing names led to almost no engagement</li>
                  <li>Make posting, replying, and sharing more robust: The commenting and sharing functions were very basic and lacked many handy functions users would expect having in a social sharing platform</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>New Partnership and Prototype</h3>
                <h6>SportsEngine</h6>
                <p>Around this time, we partnered with popular sports and team management platform SportsEngine, to bolster our userbase and help improve the web app experience for managing large rosters and teams. This was a good time to explore other coaching and inviting functions because the web app served as a promising platform for these types of tools.</p>

                <h6>Information Architecture, Sketching and Wireframes</h6>
                <p>Forking off the mobile app information architecture, we started laying the ground work for improving the web app's inviting, onboarding, and new SportsEngine roster import UX. Using our inside-to-out approach, this touched other areas of the app for us to explore and make consistent over time.</p>
                <h6>Form Design System</h6>
                <p>Similarly to mobile app, I built our web design system, breaking down designs into their most basic elements and using them to assemble views in various, but visually consistent ways. As I went a long, I documented elements and why/where to use them:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Principles and purpose: Why we are doing this and how it helps teams and users</li>
                  <li>Design language: Typography, colors, spacing and imagery standards</li>

                <h3>Staging, Feedback Loops, and Iteration</h3>
                <h6>Staging Updates and Feedback</h6>
                <p>Working closely with our teams and SportsEngine stakeholders, we iterated on the web app, particularly the inviting and Team/Space creation and management process. After an MVP was developed, we pushed the updates to our staging site for user testing with coaches and athletes. Results:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Roster import was slow and took too many steps to complete</li>
                  <li>Still need the ability to bulk upload media and schedule posts</li>
                  <li>Engagement with secondary features was better but still low</li>
                  <li>New Notification center is excellent</li>
                  <li>Replying and liking comments became more popular</li>
                </ul>
                <h6>Rolling NPS and Satisfaction Scores</h6>
                <p>With each update we pushed to staging for review, we'd setup rolling NPS metrics and kept a close eye on satisfaction scores for our various outcomes. Over time, we noticed the new creation and roster UX was more adopted and NPS scores increased for our core feature set.</p>
                <h6>Improving</h6>
                <p>By responding to the feedback and designing/developing against them in real-time, we made significant strides in a shorter amount of time. After improving the UX and applying our new brand system, the web app felt like a completely new and revamped plaform.</p>

                We launched the CoachNow web app in the fall of 2018 and continued to learn from feedback to iterate. Prior to my departure from the company in 2019, we put together a "rocket ship" mobile prototype for further user testing and a <a href="https://dfsign.co/docs/coachnow-product-brief.pdf" class="link" target="_blank">lean product brief</a> for handoff.

                <h3>Understanding and Initial Direction</h3>
                <h6>Kick Off and Meaning</h6>
                <p>We wanted to know where the original "Edufii" name came about. After the acquisition, we consulted with their team and stakeholders to get a better sense of what went behind the branding and why:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The term "Edufii" came from "education" and "edification" to foster teachable moments</li>
                  <li>The two "i's" symbolized two people coordinating and learning, coach and athlete</li>
                  <li>Originally wanted the name to become a verb, like "Google it", but for sharing and improvement</li>
                </ul>
                <h6>Initial Direction</h6>
                <p>This helped point us in the right direction initially with the philosophy and meaning of the company. After settling on the name "CoachNow", we went to work drawing up meanings while keeping ourselves in line with best rebranding practices and outlines:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Coach "now", not later</li>
                    <li>Using multiple and familiar tools for coaching success</li>
                    <li>Athlete progress is the job-to-be-done</li>
                    <li>Coaching matters</li>
                    <li>Achievement, fullfillment, and hitting milestones</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <h6>Identity Doc and Auditing</h6>
                <p>I then put together an identity system doc that highlighted the brand's mission of coaching success and athlete progress, any data and research supporting our themes, some initial prototypes and ideas, and an audit of the existing brand system.</p>

                <h3>Define Design Language</h3>
                <h6>Themes</h6>
                <p>While coming up with a new logo and mark, we started breaking down brand meaning into design themes to explore and experiment with. These would help lead us to the building blocks of our actual design language:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Coaching symbolism and objects</li>
                    <li>Athlete progress and forward movement</li>
                    <li>Timely and responsive</li>
                    <li>Multitasking and multiple hats</li>
                  </ul>
                <h6>Testing</h6>
                <p>We wanted to converge with the team and stakeholders on what "coaching" meant to them to gain some perspective and test against these hypothetical themes. By sending out some Google Form surveys, we uncovered some great insight that pointed us in the right direction on a theme and solidified our brand's meaning.</p>
                <h6>Building Blocks</h6>
                <p>Using themes and feedback to drive design language decisions, we broke it down into building blocks:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Primary palette: Bright orange/gradient and blue, indicating a new dawn and beginning</li>
                  <li>Secondary palette: Green, purple, and yellow, indicating different coaching tools and approaches</li>
                  <li>Shapes: Circular, indicating impact, focus, inclusiveness, and privacy</li>
                  <li>Typography: Modern, sans-serif, bolder</li>
                  <li>Iconography: Simplified coaching objects, rounded</li>
                  <li>Imagery: Candid, athlete driven, and coaching inspired</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Define Logo and Mark</h3>
                <h6>Ideas</h6>
                <p>At first, we were really focusing on physical representation to define our brand, things like common coaching materials. After hundreds of sketches, multiple surveys, and thorough research, we ultimately went into a different direction: metaphorical. The athlete's progress and forward movement theme kept resurfacing after working through ideas and we felt this was the path to go down to visualize our logo and mark.</p>
                <h6>Sketches</h6>
                <p>My design team spent much time sketching and ironing out this aspect of coaching. We lived in grid paper, whiteboards, and Google Draw for quite a while before landing on strong candidates to proceed with. Things like athlete representation, medals and trophies, accomplishments, crossing the finish line, and other related metaphors were hashed out.</p>
                <h6>Digitize and Refine</h6>
                <p>We landed on three strong candidates after further iterations and direction changes. They all represented fullfillment, progress, movement, and impact althetes received from coaches and instructors alike.</p>

                <h3>Format and Pressure Testing</h3>
                <h6>Visual and Format Checks</h6>
                <p>We ran our finalists through a series of visual tests to see how well they'd scale and adapt in various formats. Anything from website headers, to app stores, to printed material, we shopped them in and shared them for consensus and feedback.</p>
                <h6>Final Surveys</h6>
                <p>Upon further review, all three logos looked good and scaled well into their various formats. Now it was time to send them out to stakeholders and a small subset of users for one last round of feedback. Results:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Option 1 with the "running man" and "C"/"N" form was the clear favorite</li>
                    <li>Option 2/3 didn't really convey the athlete as well as 1</li>
                    <li>All options work well with the design language and typography</li>
                    <li>The "C"/"N" form also reminded some users of a stopwatch and time metaphor</li>

                In retrospect, this rebrand effort took quite some time and slowly became a design-by-committee approach, which is always a difficult hurdle for designers to overcome in business. However, all the inspiration, definition, refinement, and iteration led to a promising brand, visualized and brought to life by graphic design, a marketing site, apps, landing pages, emails, print, and ad campaigns.
