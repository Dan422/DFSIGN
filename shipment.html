          <h6>Background</h6>
          <p>
            Shipment was an idea a former colleague came up with and my first UX design side project. We wanted to design and create a universal, 3rd party parcel tracking desktop and mobile app for small businesses and startups alike.
          </p>
          <h6>Opportunity</h6>
          <p>
            In 2013, parcel tracking apps were becoming more available for B2B usage. Companies and small businesses needed easier and centralized ways to manage their shipped assets to and from customers. Traditionaly, people had to go through a vendor or carrier website to track down their package and frankly, those can be poor and confusing experiences. Also most of these sites relied solely on a tracking number so if you lost that, you lost your package. My colleague and I wanted to take on a fresh approach to this niche and difficult challenge.

                <h3>Discovery and Understanding</h3>
                <h6>Identifying the Problem</h6>
                <p>When my colleague approached me about Shipment, I immediately signed on because I could relate to the problem: tracking packages is a pain. When I moved from Chicago to Phoenix during that time, I had multiple items being handled by FedEx and UPS. It was a nightmare trying to centralize and track where things were and it resulted in a few things being lost.
                <br><br>
                This frustration coupled with my colleague's own research and experiences drove us to solve this.
                </p>
                <h6>Define a Goal</h6>
                <p>We also took time to see how Shipment would position in the mobile and parcel tracking market. Based on research and competitive analysis, I put together a running brief that highlighted overall business goals, demand, and expansion efforts. I then packaged this all up into one clear and concise goal:
                <br><br>
                <i>Design and implement a B2B delivery/parcel tracking app that centralizes tracking information, various delivery companies/outlets, and is seamless to use.</i>
                <br><br>

                <h3>Empathize</h3>
                <h6>Understand the User</h6>
                <p>After my initial deep-dive, I wanted to know who our ideal users would be. Based on market research, we realized that small businesses and startups would be great candidates for Shipment, having to handle multiple sales and shipping of items to customers. I then composed an empathy map with this information:</p>
                <p>Demographic</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Small business owner</li>
                  <li>Price-conscious</li>
                  <li>Wears multiple hats/"Jack of all trades"</li>
                  <li>Multitasker</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Needs</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Automated and real-time tools</li>
                  <li>Reliable and low-maintanance/setup</li>
                  <li>Up-to-minute notifications and updates</li>

                  <li>Visits multiple carrier/vendor sites for shipping info</li>
                  <li>Tries to track packages themselves, i.e. spreadsheets or by hand</li>
                  <li>Relies heavily on tracking numbers</li>

                <h3>Define and Ideate</h3>
                <h6>Existing Problems</h6>
                <p>From empathy mapping, personal experience, and conversations, I put together a list of common problems business owners face with current tracking products/sites and derived patterns:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Confusing: A lot of these carrier/vendor sites make it unusually hard to track and existing parcel; it can be hard to find</li>
                  <li>Scattered: Since there's multiple tracking numbers across carriers, many people result to tracking manually with spreadsheets and even email grouping which takes too much time</li>
                  <li>Slow: Refreshing pages constantly and no notifying; not up-to-date at all</li>
                </ul>
                <h6>Ideas</h6>
                <p>With clear problems to solve, I focused on some key aspects that would form the basis of potential solutions:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Universal: support as many carriers/vendors as possible to cast a wide net</li>
                  <li>Central: all shipments in one place, across desktop and mobile apps</li>
                  <li>Open: accept other forms of data besides just a tracking number</li>
                  <li>Real-time: keep users informed as soon as activity changes</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I then used this research and ideation to compose a simple user journey map.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="row">

                <h3>Sketch and Wireframe</h3>
                <h6>Hand Sketches</h6>
                <p>With ideas and aspects ironed out, we focused on the mobile app design that would eventually lead to desktop as well. Simple hand drawings make it much easier to iterate and exercise design concepts.</p>
                <h6>Elements and Components</h6>
                <p>I wanted to focus on reusable and global design components to help keep the UX consistent and refined:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Toolbars: Actions and icons change depending on the view</li>
                  <li>Header: Title and subtitle</li>
                  <li>Modules: Groups of relavant content</li>
                  <li>Progress bars: Indication of activity</li>
                  <li>Form fields: User input and submission</li>
                </ul>
                <h6>Wireframes</h6>
                <p>Using Photoshop, I refined our sketches into higher fidelity wireframes. This helped us visualize the product easier before further iteration and brand application.

                <h3>Feedback and Iteration</h3>
                <h6>Internal and User Review</h6>
                <p>After a round of feedback with version 1 of the prototype, I took notes and boiled it down to these key needs and asks:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Bolder/larger typography and iconography</li>
                  <li>Make form fields and buttons more obvious that they're selectable</li>
                  <li>Display tracking number up front and prominently</li>
                  <li>Replace pausing shipment option with a notification center</li>
                  <li>Include account creation and sign in process</li>
                </ul>
                <h6>Rapid Prototyping and Desktop App</h6>
                <p>When we got the mobile app to a good point with rapid prototyping, I ported the designs, paradigms, and conventions over to the desktop app. By focusing and finalizing on mobile first, design time for desktop was cut significantly.

                <h3>Product Model and CLM</h3>
                <h6>OKR and Goals</h6>
                <p>Before thinking about means of acquiring users through web presence, I started by outlining a general product model and goals:
                  <br><br>
                  1.) Freemium model to get cast a wide net for B2B adoption and usage
                  <br>
                  2.) Premium incentives and discounts for downloading apps
                  <br>
                  3.) Convert free to paid users using "low hanging fruit" and simple techniques
                </p>
                <h6>Define CLM</h6>
                <p>With a product and business model established, I wanted to build a customer lifecycle framework around our microsite and email/growth campaigns using "Pirate Metrics" or the AAARRR model:
                 <ul>

                <h6>Understand the User</h6>
                <p>During our <a href="#app" class="link">user research study</a> for the Shipment app, we realized that small businesses and startups would be great candidates for Shipment, having to handle multiple sales and shipping of items to customers:</p>
                <p>Demographic</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Small business owner</li>

                <ul>
                  <li>Visits multiple carrier/vendor sites for shipping info</li>
                  <li>Tries to track packages themselves, i.e. spreadsheets or by hand</li>

                <h3>Ideation</h3>
                <h6>Key Aspects</h6>
                <p>With users in mind for the microsite and emails, I listed out aspects that aligned with ours goals of drawing potential customers in with incentives for conversion:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Call-to-action: Have "Get Pro" and "Activate" links as prominent and frequent as possible</li>
                  <li>Minimal entry: Account creation should require minimal credentials</li>
                  <li>Clear: Have the value proposition and language around incentives be short and clear</li>
                </ul>
                <h6>Ideas</h6>
                <ul>
                  <li>Have visitors complete basic account creation steps and survey questions to get premium incentives</li>
                  <li>Linear campaign: Welcome email -> Microsite -> Download -> Convert</li>
                  <li>Survey data should be leveraged for user understanding and product evolution</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I used these ideas to sketch and wireframe the site and email layout.</p>

                <h3>Sketch and Wireframe</h3>
                <h6>Hand Sketches</h6>
                <p>With goals and flows in mind, I focused on the microsite and email designs since those would be the center pieces of the CLM pipeline. Simple hand drawings make it much easier to iterate and exercise design concepts.</p>
                <h6>Wireframes</h6>
                <p>Using InDesign first, I refined sketches into lower fidelity wireframes and options, listing out the pros and cons of each approach. This helped us visualize the product easier before further iteration and brand application.</p>
                <h6>Refinement</h6>
                <p>When we settled on a option based on optimizing desktop and mobile viewability and efficiency, I took to Photoshop and came up with a version 1 design of both form factors.

                <h6>Internal and User Review</h6>
                <p>After a round of feedback with version 1 of the microsite and welcome email prototypes, I took notes and boiled it down to these key needs and asks:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Emphasize incentive CTA more</li>
                  <li>Remove extra nav and footer links, drawing more focus on the account setup and survey sections</li>
                  <li>Briefly describe what users get in the Pro offering and its price</li>
                  <li>Make survey answers more obvious that they're single or multi select</li>
                  <li>Extend designs into basic user flows</li>
                </ul>
                <h6>Rapid Prototyping and Finalizing</h6>
                <p>After more feedback, we got the microsite and welcome email to a good point with rapid prototyping.

                <h6>Initial Direction and Themes</h6>
                <p>My colleague and I wanted branding and a logomark that conveyed the actual purpose of the product: tracking your shipment's location. Just from this initial idea, I came up with some themes to work with and evolve:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Shipping isn't just a straight line between point A and B</li>
                    <li>Use the unique shape of the "S" to show direction and movement</li>
                    <li>Trucks, loading docks, and mail carriers are synonymous with shipping</li>
                    <li>Just about the journey as it is with the destination</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <h6>Examples and Insight</h6>
                <p>With themes in mind, I put together an inspiration board with examples from competitors, stock image sites, and other delivery-centric sources.</p>

                <h3>Define Design Language</h3>
                <h6>Direction</h6>
                <p>Back in 2013, many companies in the technology space were redefining their image. Traditionally, the skeuomorphic design style was prominent, mimicking physical objects using gradients, shadows, neutral color tones, and subtle features. However, a new wave of the "flat" design movement was on the horizon, paved way by Apple's iOS 7 redesign. Design language was becoming simplified with gradients being replaced by solid, bright colors, shadows removed, and typography becoming more modern. I wanted to explore this type of design because I studied it in school and was excited to see it getting adopted again.</p>
                <h6>Themes</h6>
                <p>With a direction in mind, I started on the very basics of the Shipment design language – themes:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Forward movement and intention</li>
                    <li>Minimalistic and stripped down</li>
                    <li>Bright, heavy contrast</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <h6>Building Blocks</h6>
                <p>Using themes to drive design language decisions, I broke it down into building blocks:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Color palette: primary blue and green for positivity, secondary orange for alert and attention and dark grey for starkness</li>
                  <li>Shapes: Recrtangle, subtle round borders, flat</li>
                  <li>Typography: Modern, sans-serif, bolder</li>
                  <li>Iconography: Simple, rounded, solid</li>
                  <li>Imagery: Candid, delivery-focused</li>
                </ul>
              </div>

                <h3>Define Logo and Mark</h3>
                <h6>Ideas</h6>
                <p>Inspiration, metaphors, and themes greatly helped me understand how to approach our logo and variations. We decided to use the "S" shape that ties in with our initial theme of "shipping isn't just a straight line between point A and B".</p>
                <h6>Sketches</h6>
                <p>I started drawing elements and objects that represented this concept, focusing on the logo mark. Soon we settled on one variation of the "S" shape that clearly conveyed the start -> journey -> destination approach and iterrated on that.
                </p>
                <h6>Digitize and Refine</h6>
                <p>With a final drawn logo settled on, I went into Adobe Illustrator and designed it. We kept the various form factors in mind with the product, like App Store icons, website insertions, physical product insertions, and app icon requiements and exported.</p>
                <h6>Alternative Mark</h6>
                <p>Along with the "S" symbol, we came up with an alternative logomark that also expressed this idea of "delivery" and "physical goods" people get during the shipping process. This mark would be used for other purposes like empty states, email banners, stickers, and other smaller form factors.</p>
