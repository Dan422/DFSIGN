          <h6>Background</h6>
          <p>
            While working on <a href="golfshot" class="link">Golfshot</a> in 2016, we partnered with popular golf instruction company Revolution Golf to create a video library and spin-off app, Golfplan. The library would replace Golfshot's legacy video offering, Tips & Drills, and housed hundreds of curated golf instruction videos from leading trainers in the field, bucketed into various categories like driving, approaching, putting, sand shots, etc.
          </p>
          <h6>Opportunity</h6>
          <p>
            This was a great product for us to explore at the time. Tips & Drills needed a revamp and by adding a more robust video instruction and improvement component to our family of Golfshot apps like Golfplan, we helped fill a need for improving all aspects of a golfer's game, not just distance measurement and statistics gathering.
          </p>
          <h6>Timeline</h6>

                <h3>Discovery</h3>
                <h6>Business & Partnership Goals</h6>
                <p>We worked very closely with our partner Revolution Golf to come up with high level business needs, requirements, and goals for the app. Aspects include:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Free, pro, and long-form subscription tiers, each unlocking premium content</li>
                  <li>Videos will be streamed directly from the library through the app</li>
                  <li>Push notifications notifying users of new videos</li>
                  <li>Recommend and cater content depending on golfers skill level, pulled from Golfshot's statistics</li>
                  <li>Golfplan will be the exclusive app provider of this library</li>
                  <li>Ability to rate and review content for continuous improvement</li>
                </ul>
                <h6>Market Analysis</h6>
                <p>We then researched and compiled data from other video delivery products in the market. This helped us learn more about the position, design, and audience of various video offerings and paved way for future empathy and understanding exercises. Some things we learned:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Most apps are subscription based</li>
                  <li>Video libraries are organized by expert and opinion, but not by category nor skill type</li>
                  <li>Most videos are under 5 minutes long but don't include summaries or bullets</li>
                  <li>Conventional training is very dedicated and time-consuming, so golfers look to pre-made videos as an alternative</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Empathize and Define</h3>
                <h6>Understand the User</h6>
                <p>With a good business plan and market strategy at our back, we leveraged our persona and feedback work from both parent app <a href="golfshot" class="link">Golfshot</a> and Revolution Golf to get a clearer snapshot of our users and their needs with a new product like this:</p>
                <p>Demographic</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Older (35-65 years old)</li>
                  <li>84% male, 16% female</li>
                  <li>Social/casual golfers (1-4 times per month)</li>
                  <li>Like-amateurs/competitors (5+ per month and tournament play)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Needs</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Short and concise golf instruction</li>
                  <li>Curated, recommended, and customized tips and drills</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Behaviors</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Looking to improve some aspects of their game</li>
                  <li>Finding free golf videos and tips from Youtube/Vimeo</li>
                  <li>Purchasing expensive training from golf instructors</li>
                </ul>
                <h6>Problems</h6>
                <p>We then identified pain points to see if we can get ahead of potential issues for Golfplan:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Scattered, uncentralized videos and resources</li>
                  <li>Very expensive training</li>
                  <li>Very dedicated and time-consuming</li>

                <h3>Prototyping</h3>
                <h6>Sketches and Wireframes</h6>
                <p>With a firm understanding of our users and information architecture in place, I set to work coming up with visual concepts and rapidly prototyping against them. Some key aspects we focused on while I took to my handy grid paper:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Surface the various ways to access and view content, like categories and recommended for you, and their subcategories</li>
                  <li>Make video summaries and bullets easy to digest</li>
                  <li>Clearly differentiate free vs. premium content</li>
                  <li>Allow users to create their own libraries via favoriting</li>
                  <li>Put a review system in place that's prominent but not obtrusive</li>
                </ul>
                <h6>High Fidelity Prototypes and Flows</h6>
                <p>I took my sketches and used our existing <a href="https://golfshot.com/design/design-system" class="link">Golfshot design system</a> components and patterns to start designing the UI in Photoshop. This drastically reduced design time and made iteration and initial feedback loops with users and stakeholders more efficient.</p>

                <h3>Test and Iterate</h3>
                <h6>User Beta Testing</h6>
                <p>After iterations and development work, we built our first prototype and sent it out to a handful of internal stakeholders and users for a first round of testing.</p>
                <p>Findings</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>First impression: Main categories view felt plain and uninviting</li>
                  <li>Video/expert summaries: Need clearer visual indication that summaries are hidden and can be viewed</li>
                  <li>Favoriting: Touch target for favoriting a video was too small</li>
                  <li>Rating: The "Done" button was hard to find at first, also auto-selecting "Yes" was confusing</li>
                  <li>Recommended flow: Content and questions were too vague and confusing and users need ability to rank aspects of their game 1-5</li>
                </ul>
                <h6>Iteration</h6>
                <p>For this next round of iteration, I strived to improve the video summaries and initiating UX as much as possible, seeing that was the primary way for users to view content. We redesigned the main video cells to make it more obvious that content was expandable and tappable, while improving the content and visual design throughout.</p>
                <p>Second Round Findings</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>First impression: Added imagery is much more golf-centric and pops</li>
                  <li>Video/expert summaries: Much easier to view and start videos with the larger play button</li>
                  <li>Favoriting: Simpler to reach</li>
                  <li>Rating: Moving the "Done" button below the questions was easier to scan and making the "Yes"/"No" optional was logical here</li>
                  <li>Recommended flow: First questions are better and the 1-5 scale matrix was simple to use</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Technical Understanding and Ideation</h3>
                <h6>Apple TV Strategy and Brainstorm</h6>
                <p>After finalizing iPhone/iPad designs for Golfplan, we started working on the app's extension into Apple TV. In 2016, Apple was really pushing it's TV model as a new standard for content consumption while opening more doors for 3rd party development. As a team, we had some important decisions to make on how to approach not only the design/UX of this evolving product, but also how it will be developed. Some key questions:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Platform and stack type: should it be built natively (more complex but in our domain) or with Apple's TVML language and templates (easier but less control over design)?</li>
                  <li>Features: Since this is a unique product, do we allow for more or less features or should it be kept in parallel with iPhone/iPad?</li>
                  <li>Accessiblity: How do we evolve our design system to fit this larger form factor, but also prioritizing accessibility for our persona (older, not as technical)?</li>
                </ul>
                <h6>Direction and Design Goals</h6>
                <p>We set up spikes for the platform/features and discovered that using TVML while keeping the features in parallel with its sister Mobile Apps were best for our MVP. After drawing inspiration from other TV apps and breaking out designs from our Mobile Apps, ideas started to emerge:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Surface and prioritize a "Continue Watching" section, similar to Netflix or Hulu</li>
                  <li>Use the 2 and 3-column grid template to emphasize our main categories</li>
                  <li>Use the template's light theme vs. dark theme</li>
                  <li>Have horizontally scrolling content be hinted off screen </li>
                  <li>Actions should be focused and singluar since the user is manipulating the UI with a remote and one button</li>
                  <li>Increase our typography and brighten our color palette for better viewing and accessibility.</li>

                <h3>Prototyping</h3>
                <h6>Sketches and Wireframes</h6>
                <p>In combination of having our iPhone/iPad designs and flows stubbed out and using a TVML layout/template provided by Apple, sketching this UI was simple and required less low-fidelity iterations.</p>
                <h6>High Fidelity Prototypes and Flows</h6>
                <p>Translating our designs for a TV interface required a much more careful and thoughtout approach than anticipated. Since users were restricted to using a remote with minimal buttons and our demographic demanded larger elements for better viewing, our initial layout and typographical treatments went through several rounds of in-person and image-on-screen testing.</p>

                <h3>Test and Iterate</h3>
                <h6>Internal Testing</h6>
                <p>User testing was difficult with Apple TV because a beta program wasn't quite set up for it yet. To get feedback, we tested the app on our office TV's as well as sending our test Apple TV unit to several of our coworker's homes for testing on various formats.</p>
                <p>Findings</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Text on screen: Some of the paragraphs and disclaimers were hard to view from a distance</li>
                  <li>Selected elements: It was difficult to tell which elements were selected or not</li>
                  <li>Searching: The virtual keyboard was hard to use and took too long to type entries</li>
                  <li>Filtering videos: Having all subcategories in a grid took too long to scan/scroll</li>
                </ul>
                <h6>Iteration</h6>
                <p>After a couple weeks of gathering feedback, I made the visual adjustments to the UI.</p>
                <p>Second Round Findings</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Text on screen: Switching the typeface from Regular to Medium and increasing its size by 2pts was easier to read</li>
                  <li>Selected elements: Brightening the select color blue and making the element larger helped</li>
                  <li>Searching: Unfortunately, the search and keyboard is provided by the TVML template and can't be adjusted</li>
                  <li>Filtering videos: Moving these subcategories to just one vertically scrolling list made it easier to find what I was looking for</li>
                </ul>

                Once these tweaks were made, we shipped our first Apple TV app.
